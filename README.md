# Quake MCP Server

> ‰∏≠ÊñáËØ¥ÊòéÔºö[README_CN.md](README_CN.md).

## Overview

**Quake MCP Server** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin based on the **360 Quake Network Space Mapping Platform**. It provides two main functionalities:

- **Asset Data Query**: Retrieve detailed network asset information.
- **Asset Aggregation**: Analyze and aggregate network asset data.

By leveraging the flexibility of DSL query syntax, **Quake MCP Server** enables users to conduct network asset collection, distribution analysis, security vulnerability assessment, and network space profiling. It's an essential tool for AI environments to perform real-time asset search and statistical analysis.

## Features

### üîç Asset Data Query (`quake_service_data`)

- Allows retrieval of detailed information about network assets.
- Supports filtering by query syntax, time range, and pagination.

### üìä Asset Aggregation (`quake_service_aggregation`)

- Provides aggregated statistical data about network assets, including but not limited to::
  - Port distribution
  - Protocol/service type distribution
  - Geographical distribution

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup in NaMiAI

1. Search for **Quake MCP** in the [NaMiAI](https://www.n.cn/) MCP Toolbox.
2. Click **Install**, then enter your **API Key** to complete the configuration. (Login to the [Quake platform](https://quake.360.net/quake/#/personal?tab=message), navigate to **User Center ‚Üí API Token**, to obtain your **API Key**)
3. Once setup is complete, you can start using the Quake MCP Server to perform asset queries and aggregation.

## API Usage

### 1. Asset Data Query (`quake_service_data`)

**Description**  
Fetch detailed information about network assets based on the provided query syntax.

**Parameters:**

- `query` (string, required): DSL query string (e.g., `domain:"example.com"`).
- `start_time` (string, optional): Start time for the query in UTC format.
- `end_time` (string, optional): End time for the query in UTC format.
- `start` (int, optional): Pagination start, default is `0`.
- `size` (int, optional): Number of results per page, default is `100`.

**Response:**

- `code`: Response code (0 indicates success).
- `message`: Response message (e.g., `"Successful."`).
- `total_count`: Total number of assets found.
- `data`: List of asset details (IP, port, service, geographical location, etc.).
- `meta`: Pagination details.

### 2. Asset Aggregation (`quake_service_aggregation`)

**Description**  
Returns aggregated statistical data for network assets based on a query.

**Parameters:**

- `query` (string, required): DSL query string (e.g., `country:CN`).
- `start_time` (string, optional): Start time for the query in UTC format.
- `end_time` (string, optional): End time for the query in UTC format.

**Response:**

- `code`: Response code (0 indicates success).
- `message`: Response message (e.g., `"Successful."`).
- `data`: Aggregated data (e.g., port distribution, service types, geographical distribution).

---

## Use Cases

- **Network Asset Collection**: Quickly obtain network asset information for specified domains, IPs, or organizations.
- **Asset Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of assets across ports, protocols/service types, and geographical locations.
- **Security Vulnerability Assessment**: Help identify potential risky assets and abnormal services.
- **Network Space Profiling**: Combine asset data and aggregation statistics to generate a comprehensive network space view for an organization or region.

## FAQ

### Q1: What is DSL query syntax?

DSL (Domain Specific Language) query syntax is used to search for assets in Quake. Example queries include:

- `domain:"example.com"`: Search for assets under the domain `example.com`.
- `port:22 AND country:CN`: Search for assets exposed on port 22 in China.

### Q2: How to obtain an API Token?

Login to the [Quake platform](https://quake.360.net/quake/#/personal?tab=message), navigate to **User Center ‚Üí API Token**, and generate a new token.

### Q3: What is the query result points deduction mechanism?

The points deduction mechanism is aligned with the API call deduction system. Deduct points based on the query frequency and data retrieval.
